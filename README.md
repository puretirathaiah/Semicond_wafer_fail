# Semiconductor manufacturing - wafer fault detection.

Problem statement: Implementing a model to detect a fault wafer providing the data from a large set of sensors.

To train the models, the data of failed and passed wafers is taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SECOM.

Jypyter notebook is used to perform:
  - data preperation
  - feature scaling
  - model training
  - undersampling and oversampling
  - principal components
